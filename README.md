# Computer-Vision-Car
Mission: The goal of this car is to detect/avoid objects and follow a track without a driver.
The car will use computer vision to guide the car to the intended location and complete the created track.

Step By Step

1. Object Detection
	1. Set up a Virtual Environment
	2. Collect images using a Web Cam
	3. Label Images using Labellmg
	4. Train the Tensorflow Object Detection Model
	5. Install Tensorflow Object Detection for Python
	6. Install CUDA and CuDNN(NVIDA)
	7. Use the TensorFlow Zoo model
	8. Create Tensor Flow Records
 	9. Training Tensorflow Object Detection Models for Python
 	10. Evaluating OD Models (Precision and Recall)
 	11. Evaluating OD Models using Tensorboard
	12. Detecting Objects from Images and Webcams
 	13. Detecting Objects in Images
	14. Detecting Objects in Real Time using a Webcam
	15. Freezing TFOD and Converting to TFJS and TFLite
	16. Freezing the Tensorflow Graph
	17. Converting Object Detection Models to TFLite
	18. Performance Tuning to Improve Precision and Recall
	19. Training Object Detection Models on Colab
	20.  Object Detection Projects with Python
	21.  Sentiment Detection on a Raspberry Pi Using TFLite

2. Build Car and Track
